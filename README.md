# Project HoloTrack

HoloTrack is a DLib/OpenCV-based Face Tracking software for Live2D-based models using osu!framework. Unlike most solutions like FaceRig, HoloTrack is:

- Built always on the latest C# standards - we do not need to wait for engines like Unity to support a C# version to do what we want.
- Open source, from the very core - HoloTrack is 100% free and open source. No gotchas. 
- Always evolving - HoloTrack improves every update, that includes dataset updates to improve face landmark recognition.

## Running

TBA

## Roadmap

So far this is our roadmap. Keep in mind there is no gurantees anything we release is stable once I finalized this roadmap:

- [ ] Model parsing and interchange format.
- [ ] Mutliple model tracking support.
- [ ] Multiplayer mode  - recognize and track more than one subject and link them to a subject.
- [ ] Remote Camera support - use any kind of device other than the local camera to be used.
- [ ] Kinect support (Azure Kinect, Kinect for Xbox One, Kinect for Xbox 360).

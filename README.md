# Project holotrack

holotrack is a DLib/OpenCV-based Face Tracking software for Live2D-based models using osu!framework. Unlike most solutions like FaceRig, holotrack is:

- Built always on the latest C# standards - we do not need to wait for engines like Unity to support a C# version to do what we want.
- Open source, from the very core - holotrack is 100% free and open source. No gotchas. 
- Always evolving - holotrack improves every update, that includes dataset updates to improve face landmark recognition.

## Motivation

Most "VTuber"-oriented applications are too expensive or out of reach for most content creators. Even if it was on reach, they either underperform because they fail to account to what hardware is available
for the content creator. holotrack might be basic compared to contemporaries but its primary aim is to lower the barrier of entry for content creation regarding virtual YouTubers. 

Another motivation of this is because I was "forced" to make this. Don't ask who and why. They just did.

## Running

TBA

## Roadmap

So far this is our roadmap. Keep in mind there is no gurantees anything we release is stable once I finalized this roadmap:

- [ ] Model parsing and interchange format.
- [ ] Remote Camera support - use any kind of device other than the local camera to be used.
- [ ] Kinect support (Azure Kinect, Kinect for Xbox One, Kinect for Xbox 360).
